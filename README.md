<p align="center"><i> iOS developer student and react developer jr. </i></p>

<h3> about me, </h3>
<p> I like to play League of Legends, Dead By Daylight, and similar games. My current motivation is to feed my two cats, Dante and Yuumi. </p>

<h3> languages, </h3>
<p><i><strong>
 Javascript</strong> is my <em>"native"</em> programming language, I've been working with it since the beginning of my career, using React on the front, React Native on mobile and Node on the back. I acquired my initial knowledge through school, then I sought to improve with courses from Rocketseat and Alura.
</i></p>
<p><i>
 After experience with hybrid mobile development using React Native, I became very interested in the area where I sought knowledge in native iOS development with <strong>Swift</strong>. Currently I am taking courses through Alura and Udemy with teacher Eric Brito.
